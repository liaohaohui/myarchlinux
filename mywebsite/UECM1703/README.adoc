== Practical Slides

* Week 1: link:p01_basic.pdf[Practical Slide 1: Basic Python Programming]

* Week 2: link:p02_array.pdf[Practical Slide 2: Array Programming]
** In this practical, we will start with simple middle-school matrix
and then proceed to simple image processing in Numpy array.  It is hope 
that through this practical one will appreciate the complexity of image
processing.

* Week 3: link:p03_adv.pdf[Practical Slide 3: Advanced Programming]
** In this practical, you will learn to relate for loop and array programming
