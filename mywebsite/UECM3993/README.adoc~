=  UECM3993 Predictive Modelling (Jan 2021)

The course outcomes are

* CO1: Describe the key concept of statistical learning;
* CO2: Compare statistical models for prediction and estimation through supervised learning;
* CO3: Identify relationship and structures from unlabelled data through unsupervised learning;
* CO4: Demonstrate supervised and unsupervised learning with statistical software;
* CO5: Interpret results from supervised and unsupervised learning.


== Announcements

* Week 4: Assignment will be announced.
* Week 2: Submission of the assignment group name and member names, student id, etc.
* Week 1: Form assignment groups
* Week 1: Practical and Tutorial start from Week 1; Week 2 Thursday is 
Thaipusam, so no Tutorial in Week 2.
