= My Arch Linux

Arch Linux used to be the best Linux distro for my personal preference.
But the systemd's configuration is so different from Unix philosophy (for me is
small and lean tools with not too many dependencies) that after search around
on Internet, I still don't know how to create core dump file.  I am forced to
use systemd coredump!  Why am I forced to use what systemd think is the best?

So I switch to Artix with OpenRC as well as OpenBSD (and FreeBSD). 


== OpenBSD

OpenBSD is slow on a slow machine.  So I have to explore how to do
screencasting:

1. ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 12 -codec:v libx264rgb -crf 0 -preset -ultrafast video.mkv
2. aucat -o audio.wav


== Artix Linux
